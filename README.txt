Bouncy ball is a project where I didn’t use of the unity rigidbodies or colliders in order to check collision and keep the balls in the screen.
At first it was quite difficult to find how to check the collisions but that got quite easy after a while.

Then I added a trail render for fun mostly but also to check where the balls went on the screen,
and to see where the system decided its next step would be out of the screen. 
And if that was the case it would reverse the vector and it would bounce away. 

When any of the spheres have a collision with another sphere the spheres become blue in order to see it, same with the cubes.
